### Answer :crystal_ball:

A repository _does_ exist at githubtraining/training-manual.

<summary>Why can't you see it then? Review the **Files Changed** tab and see if you can figure it out. Collapse this text if you'd like an explanation.</summary>

The repository `training-manual` in the @githubtraining organization is private, and only visible to memebers of that organization. If you're not a member of the organization, it'll appear like the repository doesn't exist to you. This is an example of why having the right ownership structure is important. Having too many organizations with restrictive permissions means that each organization's work will be siloed.

Here are some recommendations based on some :sparkles: use of GitHub that we've seen:
- aim for as few organizations as possible, remember: each organization is a black box to those outside of that organization
- name your repositories in a meaningful manner, usually a simple project or application name will suffice
