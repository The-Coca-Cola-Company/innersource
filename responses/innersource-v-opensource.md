### Answer :crystal_ball:

Innersource and open source are very similar concepts, but they're not the same.

**Open source** software public and typically accepts contributions from outside of an organization.

**Innersource** is the practice of adopting open source practices internally within your organization. An organization that practices innersource, may or may not end up open sourced.
