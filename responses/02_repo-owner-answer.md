### Answer :crystal_ball:

A repository _does_ exist at githubtraining/training-manual, but it is private.

The repository `training-manual` in the @githubtraining organization is private. It's only visible to members of that organization. If you're not a member of the organization, it'll appear like the repository doesn't exist to you. This is an example of why having the right ownership structure is important. Having too many organizations with restrictive permissions silos and isolates each organization's work.

Here are some recommendations based on some :sparkles: use of GitHub that we've seen:
- Aim for as few organizations as possible. Remember, each organization is a black box to those outside of that organization.
- Name your repositories in a meaningful manner. Usually a simple project or application name will suffice.
