- Open PR for repo ownership
- response contains challenge question: true/false there is a repository at https://github.com/githubtraining/training-manual
- answer: true, it _does_ exist, but it is a repository private to the github organization, so it's not visible, this is because of org permissions. Private repositories in the org are only visible by members of that org
