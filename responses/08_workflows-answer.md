### Answer :crystal_ball:

The real answer is that, without documentation, we don't know!

This PR covers the basics, but here are some recommendations to help any contributor know the right way to open pull requests: 
- use protected branches, doing so will allow you to accept PRs without fear of breaking production code
- use Codeowners in combination with protected branches, to ensure that the right people are pinged for specific changes
- if you haven't picked a workflow, use a common and well documented one that your contributors can easily search for
- be explicit about your deployment and release strategy

Please merge this PR.
