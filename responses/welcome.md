This repository will eventually be a working web site that you'll be able to publish internally as your own Innersource commons.

[IMAGE OF FINAL PRODUCT]

As we work on this repo, we'll be creating a resource others can use within your organization. This repo can continue to be used after the course is finished. 

This is how this course will move along:
- every new issue or pull request will start with a challenge question
- you'll answer the challenge question; don't worry, there are no right or wrong answers
- the question will highlight why each topic is an important part of applying Innersource practices right

Here's your first challenge question!

### Challenge question

- [ ] True
- [ ] False

I'll respond when you select one of the options above.
