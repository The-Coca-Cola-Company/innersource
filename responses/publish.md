### Almost done!

It's now time to publish the innersource toolkit you've been working on throughout this course.

To publish:
1. Go to the **Settings** tab for this repository.
1. Scroll down to the section titled _GitHub Pages_
1. Select **master branch** in the Source drop down.

That's all! GitHub Pages will then deploy your site and repo its status back to me. I'll respond when I detect that GitHub pages has finished deploying your site.
